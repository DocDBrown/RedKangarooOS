RedKangarooOS is an open-source, Rust-based operating system designed for performance, security, and scalability. This project aims to provide a modern, efficient, and flexible OS platform built entirely with Rust. The first prioity is to complete the bootloader. This is a long term project and will take time to complete...

If no-one lese contributes I guarnatee 100% that I will continue and finish the project myself. I remain resolute in my decisions and maintain my principles of integrity, justice, hard work and respect for other people.
